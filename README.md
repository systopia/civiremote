CiviRemote
===========

The *CiviRemote* module, and included sub-modules, is a front-end implementation
of the [*CiviRemote*](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.remotetools)
framework, and specifically for the [*CiviRemote
Event* CiviCRM extension](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.remoteevent),
allowing for CiviCRM event registration (including update/cancellation) on a
Drupal website with connection to a CiviCRM instance via the [
*CiviMRF*](https://drupal.org/project/cmrf_core) framework.
